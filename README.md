# GxEPD2 forked from https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2
## Arduino / Raspberry Pi Display Library for SPI E-Paper Displays

### Notes
- See https://github.com/ZinggJM/GxEPD2 for documentation on supported e-paper devices
- This fork extends GxEPD2 to work on a Raspberry Pi
- Uses the wiringPi library for access to pins
- SPI interface to the e-paper device 
- Includes a simple version of the AdaFruit GFX library
- This fork is of v1.3.7

### important note :
- the display panels are for 3.3V supply and 3.3V data lines
- never connect data lines directly to 5V Arduino data pins, use e.g. 4k7/10k resistor divider
- series resistor only is not enough for reliable operation (back-feed effect through protection diodes)
- 4k7/10k resistor divider may not work with flat cable extensions or Waveshare 4.2 board, use level converter then
- do not forget to connect GND
- the actual Waveshare display boards now have level converters and series regulator, safe for 5V
- use 3k3 pull-down on SS for ESP8266 for boards with level converters
- note that 7.5" e-paper displays don't work reliable if fed from 3.3V Arduino pin
- note that Waveshare bords with "clever" reset circuit may need shortened reset pulse
- use `init(115200, true, 2, false)` for Waveshare boards with "clever" reset circuit
- note that Waveshare bords with "clever" reset circuit need 1k pull-up on RST on ESP8266, or different pin

### Paged Drawing, Picture Loop
 - This library uses paged drawing to limit RAM use and cope with missing single pixel update support
 - buffer size can be selected in the application by template parameter page_height, see GxEPD2_Example
 - Paged drawing is implemented as picture loop, like in U8G2 (Oliver Kraus)
 - see https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib/wiki/tpictureloop
 - Paged drawing is also available using drawPaged() and drawCallback(), like in GxEPD
- ` // GxEPD style paged drawing; drawCallback() is called as many times as needed `
- ` void drawPaged(void (*drawCallback)(const void*), const void* pv) `
- paged drawing is done using Adafruit_GFX methods inside picture loop or drawCallback

### Full Screen Buffer Support
 - full screen buffer is selected by setting template parameter page_height to display height
 - drawing to full screen buffer is done using Adafruit_GFX methods without picture loop or drawCallback
 - and then calling method display()

### Low Level Bitmap Drawing Support
 - bitmap drawing support to the controller memory and screen is available:
 - either through the template class instance methods that forward calls to the base display class
 - or directly using an instance of a base display class and calling its methods directly

### Supporting Arduino Forum Topics:

- Good Display ePaper for ArduinoÂ : https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=436411.0

### Note on documentation
- GxEPD2 uses Adafruit_GFX for Graphics and Text support, which is well documented there
- GxEPD2 uses meaningful method names, and has some comments in the header files
- consult the header files GxEPD2_BW.h, GxEPD2_3C.h and GxEPD2_GFX.h
- for the concept of paged drawing and picture loop see:
